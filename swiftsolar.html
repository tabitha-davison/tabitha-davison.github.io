        <h1>Company Overview</h1>
        <p>I had the pleasure of working at <a href="www.swiftsolar.com">Swift Solar</a> as a Data Engineer in Spring 2021! Swift was founded in 2017
        with the mission of commericializing a next generation perovskite tandem solar cell that could reach over 30% efficiency (for context, most 
        existing solar cells reach between 15-20% efficiency).
        </p>

        <h1>My Work</h1>
        <p>My role there as a Data Engineer to develop the first instance of their big data automation pipeline. The solar cell development process
            by nature contains a lot of data: in every experiment, a certain number of variables are changed, and the output of the experiments are
            run through data analysis processes to characterize the results.</p>
        <p>As the company scaled in R&D efforts, data processing speeds would slowly 
            become a bottleneck. Everyone on the team had their own versions of spreadsheets and scripts to analyze data, and there was no centralized 
            or unified way to communicate or aggregate findings from experiments.
        </p>
        <p>As such, my work was two-fold. I developed:
            <ul>
                <li>Automated python data analysis scripts</li>
                <li>A web-app platform to input experimental data, track samples, process + analysis test data, and provide summary reports of test results</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>Key Learnings</h1>
        <p>
            This was my first non-mechanical engineering role, so I got very familiar with python and automating the data analysis process: how to clean 
            up the data files, pull out key variables, do math on dataframes, and save automated plots.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through developing a web-app, I also got the chance to learn full-stack web development for the first time. I worked with a SQL database,
            used Django to structure the back-end and manage the data securely, and used React for the front-end to develop a user-friendly interface
            that focused on solving the needs of the team.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of technical learnings, I was exposed to the solar cell development process, which was super cool to learn about! 
            I saw the fundamentals of materials science & development in action, and saw the tenacity and volume of R&D experiments 
            needed to reach success.
