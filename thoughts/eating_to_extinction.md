Throught reading this book, I learned *a lot* about how we got to the food systems we have today (industrial, monocrop and monopolized agriculture), and how quickly that changed from the way we used to grow food and eat. The result of this transition is a rapid loss of biodiversity, and with it, resiliency.

> *The human diet has undergone more change in the last 150 years (roughly 6 generations) than in the entire previous one million years (around 40,000 generations). And in the last half a century, trade, technology and corporate power have extended these dietary changes right across the world.*

## How did we get here?

The [Green Revolution](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0912953109) in the 50’s was the start of it all — a new wave of technologies that drastically improved crop yields helped the world avert from famine and helped eliminate the food security problem of the developing world. At the same time, the new agricultural techniques oversimplified nature, and we are starting to see the consequences of it. Fields of identical wheat meant thousands of highly adapted and resilient varieties were abandoned. On-demand fertilizer and irrigation replaced thousands of years of localized farming techniques.

While the solutions from the Green Revolution were meant to be temporary, they proved so profitable that US foundations and entities continued to fund the implementation — often pushing cash crops onto local economies.

- *Under US occupation [of Okinawa], more sugar cane was planted as a cash crop, replacing the diverse foods farmers had grown for islanders. Instead, Californian rice, wheat from Kansas, tinned American pork (Spam) and soybeans grown in Iowa were imported. There was little incentive to save the O-Higu as huge amounts of soy were imported to Asia, not only from the USA but, increasingly, from other parts of the Americas.*
- *Funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, farmers were handed free supplies of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides; agriculture in Turkey underwent more change in a single generation than it had in five hundred years.*
- *What became known as the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Phillippines was funded by the American Rockefeller and Ford Foundations. The IRRI’s plant breeders also made a breakthrough drawing on the genetics of a dwarf plan. This new pest-resistant, high-yielding rice, called IR8, was released across India, Pakistan and Bangladesh in 1966. Using the Green Revolution package of irrigation, fertilizers and pesticides, IR8 tripled yields and became known as ‘miracle rice’. As it rapidly spread across Asia (with the necessary agrichemicals subsidized by Western foundations and governments), farmers were encouraged to abandon their landrace varieties.*

By participating in the global agricultural market, farmers worldwide are now depending on the global market rather than feeding local communities directly. The consolidation of agricultural practices also led to the monopolization of plant and livestock species:

- *The source of much of the world’s food — seeds — is mostly in the control of just four corporations; half of all the world’s cheese are produced with bacteria or enzymes manufactured by a single company; one in four beers drunk around the world is the product of one brewer; from the USA to China, most global pork production is based around the genetics of a single breed of pig; and, perhaps most famously, although there are more than 1,500 different varieties of banana, global trade is dominated by just one, the Cavendish, a cloned fruit grown in monocultures so vast their scale can only be comprehended from the view of an airplane or by satellite.*
- *To achieve these increases, animals were taken on the same path as food crops: we narrowed diversity on a global scale to suit our needs. More than 95 percent of America’s dairy herd is based around one breed of ‘super cow’, the Holstein (and most of these animals can be linked back to a handful of males)… Just three breeding lines dominate global poultry production, and most pork is based around the genetics of a single breed, the Large White.*

This means whether you live in Shanghai, China or Portland, Oregon, you will likely be eating the same species of pork, processed through the same global supply chain, artifically made cheaper by government subsidies of agricultural supplies and the fossil fuel industry (used in a big part to make ammonia, our synthetic fertilizer). The subsidies total up to $700B to $1T a year, which all the more distorts what the world chooses to grow and eat.

These practices also lead to ethical questions around how we should and shouldn’t be raising livestock — a prime example being the “Blind Hens’ Challenge”, explored by many animal ethicisists:

- *The idea was explored in the 1980s using a line of birds which were born blind due to a genetic mutation. Like the ones in the Brazilian story, the chickens displayed no signs of feather-pecking or acts of cannibalism. “They did not appear to have any other obvious welfare problems, and they were more productive,”… “This seemed, so to speak, to be a win-win situation: Farmers would make more money and hens would live better lives.’ Bigger, faster and, for our benefit, even blind?”*

## What are we losing?

Through industrialized agriculture, we are losing biodiverisity and causing expedited collapse of ecosystems and keystone species. 

- *Since the advent of industrial fishing the decline of some fish species has been truly shocking; Pacific bluefin tuna down 97 percent from historic levels; and Mediterranean swordfish, 88 percent. In more recent times, keystone species such as the Pacific sardine have seen populations crash by as much as 95 percent.*

Human health is also suffering as our food quality gets poorer (less nutrients are recycled back in our soils) and the lack of diverisity results in poorer gut microbiomes. 

- *Although wild foods provide less than 1 percent of all the calories consumed around the world today, they account for a much higher proportion of nutrients. Among hunter-gatherers such as the Hadza, rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer are so low that cases are hard to find. This is partly because of the rich diversity of foods they eat and the high levels of fibre they consume (five times more than people in the indstrialised world).*
- *Bitterness and sourness, both associated with wild foods, are often signals of health-giving properties. In the Peruvian Amazon, people gather camu camu (Myrciaria dubia), a fruit which resembles a cherry and contains twenty times more vitamin C than an orange.”*
    - *The orange varieties selected had low levels of phenols, bitter-tasting (but also health-giving) compounds. This meant they appealed to the increasingly sweet global palate, but left the global crop more vulnerable to pests and diseases because the bitter chemicals present in wild citrus such as memang narang are a big part of the plant’s natural defenses. As we reduce these compounds in our quest for more sweetness, farmers have to compensate and protect the fruit with more chemical sprays.*

Last but not least, power in communities are lost is it’s transfered to multinational entities that monopolize the food and agricultural industries.

- *The grassroots movement Sin Maiz, No Hay Pais (Without Maize There Is No Country) was founded in 2007, in part to defend Mexico’s maize culture and to combat the decline in traditional agriculture. It argued that in losing local landraces and being exposed to global markets, rural communities had lost income and autonomy and so it has called for a renegotiation of NAFTA and the promotion of domestically produced maize.*

## What should our food systems look like instead?

We should be following permaculture practices rather than growing plants in monocultures — in doing so, we fundamentally **do not need** the use of additional fertilizers or irrigation if the plants are well adapted to the local environment.

- *In the milpa system, mize is planted with its companions, beans and squashes, its stalks creating a frame for the beans to climb and the broad leaves of the squash giving ground cover, conserving moisture in the soil and suppressing weeds. But the most important feature of the milpa is what happens below ground; the leguminous roots of the bean are host to microbes which fix nitrogen into the soil and help fertilise the other crops.*

Our future food is going to depend on multiple systems (both highly industrialized and smaller scale farming), but the key is wild genetics + rethinking the monoculture model: saving diversity gives us options. The “slow food network” is an emerging framework that can help us move beyond the harmful structure brought in by the Green Revolution.
