I’ve always had unanswered questions around the military and national defense — how critical are these components of society in the modern day? Why do we still invest *so much money* into them rather than other infrastructure that may be more beneficial to our day to day? Is it because in the bigger picture, war is a part of human nature, and as such, we’ll always need investments into standing armies and weapons of mass destruction?

This book gave a systematic framework to look at causes for why human societies fight, and how we can build systems that enable more long-term peace. Blattman argues that violent wars are typically the last resort of any conflict between groups — diplomacy, trade negotations and other deals would’ve likely been attempted before any group decided to resort to war.

According to Blattman, the five causes of war are:

1. **Unchecked Interests** — powerful leaders who can make decisions based on personal gains/interests but don’t feel the repurcussions of those actions are more likely to go to war
2. **Intangible Incentives** — the want for honor, vengeance, or a sense of injustice in a group of people can override their want for peace
3. **Uncertainty** — when two sides in conflict don’t share the same information and don’t know what the other side knows, uncertainty grows, leading them to make speculations on the balance of power that can lead to war
4. **Commitment Problems** — two sides in conflict may make a deal, but with uncertainty comes a lack of trust in the commitment being honored, resulting in further action to mitigate imbalances of power
5. **Misperceptions** — either side in conflict may misjudge the resources needed to support a war, as well as what their opponent is capable of

The book argues that war never happens from one cause, and it’s usually a combination of the above factors that lead to conflict escalating to war. However, ways to mitigate violent conflict and promote peace include:

1. **Interdependence** — when groups are interdependent for resources, they are less likely to go to war because the losses they both suffer will be greater
2. **Checks and Balances** — accountability for the costs of war reduces the chances of any given leader to wage it based on personal whims or interests: decentralizing power is the key for effective accountability
3. **Rules and Enforcement** — allowing laws to be enforced by national and international governing bodies helps them foster peace
4. **Interventions** — lots of different frameworks can also change incentives: punishment (sanctions), enforcing (the UN), facilitating (international negotations), socializing, incentivizing (foreign aid)

While the factors above help lead to peace, Blattman also makes it clear that the road to peace is long and takes time — opposite to the expectation of most foreign aid missions and programs. He emphasizes that most NGOs and governments oversimply problems and articulate grand visions with standardized solutions that they apply everywhere in the globe, these practices often lead to mediocre outcomes at best, and disaster at worst.

As such, he proposes the framework of “the Peacemeal Engineer”. Highlights of this framework (with examples in italics from the book) include:

- The peacemeal engineer’s job is to end the most extreme suffering and disasters, which is where the focus should be
- Be realistic about the path to peace and what solutions you should implement
    - Many easy problems *can* be quickly solved with straightforward solutions (like disease outbreaks, which employ mass vacination campaigns that have a standard procedure and easy measures of success), but complicated problems with multiple interconnected root causes require customizing the solution to each context
        - *People, whether they are elites/separated from the problem or not, should approach each problem with humility and think critically about whose interests will be served.*
    - Avoid blindly imitating and replicating frameworks from successful societies
        - *When everything is a priority, nothing is a priority — weak states need to make trade offs for what they handle vs what they let the nonprofit sector handle.*
        - *For many nations, rather than customize rules and institutions for a weak and underfunded state, they set up a lengthy and familiar list of ministries — of planning, justic, health, gender, sports and youth. With all these ministries, weak states get distracted from their core and unique functions — defense, policing and justice — and instead busy themselves trying to imitate a more stable and advanced welfare state.*
        - *Afghanistan and Liberia were never going to develop high-functioning states in a couple of decades. Either country would count itself among the best performances in human history if it got there in a hundred years.*
        - *Local taxpayers and donors typically set unrealistic expectations — if Guatemala reduced corruption by 3% in 5 years, that pace would be one of the most successful in history. If donors deride them for the 97% remaining, what’s the incentive to improve?*
- Solutions to peace are never apolitical, and the best solutions come from decentralized decision making and transparent calls for action with a design thinking mindset
    - Polycentric — decision making with many centers. These provide checks and balances that promote peace and enable effective governments.
        - *Transparent systems that put information in the hands of the public: how much the local schools received in public funding, who got public sector jobs and at what salaries, politicians declaring assets and criminal records. Through this, better policies emerge and bad ones die.*
    - Every new rule and every intervention changes the balance of power — every policy has winners and losers. And losers will try to undermine the change every step of the way.
    - Explore and experiment. Structured trial and error. Every project should have a plan to monitor results and adjust to failure. Look at the data, evidence and come up with new programs to try, field-test and study.
        - *Open calls for new ideas, transparent competition for scarce funds, local officials and nonprofits with equal seats at the table, a focus on data and measurement, and careful attention to what’s working and what’s not.*
        - *Avoid reforms of a complexity and scope that makes it impossible to disentangle cause and effect — marginalism requires the mindset of a tinkerer: an open mind to many alternatives, trying to squeeze out the greatest gains at the least cost; being self-critical, trying to see what works; and being attuned to consequences both intended and unintended.*
