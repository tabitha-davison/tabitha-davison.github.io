      <h1>Project Context + Goals</h1>
      <p>
        In the second semester of my first year in college, I took a class called "Products & Markets".
        This class taught us the fundamentals of "value" in society, and how to create "value". To put this into
        practice, we had multiple projects in rapid succession where we iterated through problem discovery,
        customer research, and prototyping solutions to the problems we found.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the last project we had of the semester, my team and I came across the problem of <b>events coordination</b>
        in our school. We found that the main way people announced events were to send "all-student" and "all-faculty"
        emails, but this resulted in a few problems:
      <ul>
        <li>People's inboxes were getting increasing cluttered with event announcements</li>
        <li>Everyone had to manually add events into their calendars if they wanted a reminder of when & where it was
          held</li>
        <li>There wasn't any way for event hosts to keep track of interest or # of RSVPs to the invite</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>After discovery that problem, our team's goal was to get the best understanding we could of people's needs and
        pain points
        in order to build the best solution we could to the problem &mdash; and that's exactly what we did.
      </p>

      <h1>My Work</h1>
      <p>
        My direct contributions to this project include leading the team through effective project management as the
        team lead,
        managing customer research and our list of product requirements as the product manager, and helping fully
        develop the
        front-end of our platform as a UI/UX engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
        As PM, I structured effective bi-weekly sprints to make sure we were iterating quickly through the ideation
        process, which
        helped us save a lot of time when we started product development because we knew exactly what we needed to
        build.

      <h1>Key Learnings</h1>
      <p>
        This was one of my favorite projects to have ever worked on because of a couple of reasons: I had a high level
        of ownership throughout
        the entire process, my teammates were fantastic to work with, and <b>we ended up building a really successful
          project that solved the
          problem we found.</b> We were successful because we:
      <ul>
        <li>Rigorously dove into the problem and customer discovery process and talked to <i>over 20% of people</i> in
          our community
          to get insights</li>
        <li>Iterated quickly through the prototyping phase and started <i>not by building from scratch</i> but with
          <i>existing solutions</i>
          to further understand product requirements</li>
        <li>Truly understood what our value proposition was and what our MVP needed to look like in order to effectively
          use our resources</li>
      </ul>
